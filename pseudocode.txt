This is a text file where I formulate my ideas into a psuedo-code
before writing any code 

Step 1 Create a new Branch called novina2 - done
Step 2 From within the lambdatimes folder run yarn and then yarn start.
This will open your locally hosted application in your browser. - done
Step 3 Inside the Content folder you will find all 5 components that make up 
the content of the application. The flow goes like this: 
Content > Tabs > Tab and Content > Cards > Card.
Follow the directions in the Content component to get your data ready.
Tabs 
Map over the tabs - Done
Create a new tab component - Done
Add selectTabHandle, selectedTab & tab as props - Done
Tab
IF tab prop matches the selectedTab prop -> className should be tab active-tab
ELSE className should be tab - Done

Create selectHandler function from props
Pass the tab in as an argument to this handler - Done

Cards 
Map over the cards - Done
Create a new card component for each passing the card as the only prop - Done

Card.
Pass in headline, img and author props - Done

Step 4
Once the component has mounted, get the data and reflect that data on the state.
Call setState with data by passing in an object - Done

Step 5
complete the changeSelected and filterCards functions in the Content component.

changeSelected function should take in the tab and
update the state with the new tab. - Done

filterCards function returns an array of cards, so we can just pass it down as such.
IF selectedTab is 'all' then return all
ELSE return those cards whose 'tab' matches this.state.selected
