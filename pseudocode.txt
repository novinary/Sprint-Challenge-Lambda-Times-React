This is a text file where I formulate my ideas into a psuedo-code
before writing any code 

Step 1 Create a new Branch called novina2 - done
Step 2 From within the lambdatimes folder run yarn and then yarn start.
This will open your locally hosted application in your browser. - done
Step 3 Inside the Content folder you will find all 5 components that make up 
the content of the application. The flow goes like this: 
Content > Tabs > Tab and Content > Cards > Card.
Follow the directions in the Content component to get your data ready.
Tabs 
Map over the tabs - Done
Create a new tab component - Done
Add selectTabHandle, selectedTab & tab as props - Done
Tab
IF tab prop matches the selectedTab prop -> className should be tab active-tab
ELSE className should be tab - Done

Create selectHandler function from props
Pass the tab in as an argument to this handler - Done

Cards 
Card.
